# Performance playground

A collection of code examples to explore performance, primarily in form of memory optimizations.

## Build

- javascript: install nodejs
- csharp: install dotnet
- cpp: I recommend you install the C++ build tools via Visual Studio. And then update env.bat to point to a similar path as the one already there. That will make
 the `cl` (MSVC) compiler available in your terminal. And you can then use the `compile.bat` files in the different directories to run the code.
